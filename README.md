# Classifying-Cherry-s-Coffee-using-ANN-and-KNN
 After harvesting cherrys coffee farmers still use the conventional way of choosing coffee cherrys that are suitable for harvest. This makes it very difficult for farmers because the coffee plantations are planted in the mountains, the constraint is not only the difficulty of water but also the availability of containers that must be able to load a lot. This makes it very difficult for farmers if the dry season comes. In this study, proposing the use of IT to solve problems with energy saving. This way used machine learning for classification. It is hoped that this method can save energy and facilitate coffee farmers. The main goal is the results of this study can prove that the results of a computer cherry coffee classification analysis results are the same as the classification done using the human eye that has been done. The method used for texture recognition is the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method.The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm  was used in this study. Just for education and scient.
